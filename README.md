# LikeBox

A project for fun that allows one person to like another person form their contacts and allows another person to like that 
person back. Only if both parties like each other is the other notified. This was a primitive Tinder that I started during 
my freshman year in 2012. Not done by any means, but I did it whilst learning Android for fun.
