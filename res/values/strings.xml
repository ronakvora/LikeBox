        you know you want to be more than just friends, but are too afraid to because you don\'t
        know if they feel the same way? Then, you\'re in the right place! LikeBox lets you like people 
        in your contacts, but doesn\'t notify them until they like you back. The button on the right
        will lead you to a list of all your contacts; the button on your left to a list of your likes
        and mutual likes.</string>
